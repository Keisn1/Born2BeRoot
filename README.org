* What is virutal Box
VirtualBox is an open-source virtualization software developed by Oracle.
It allows users to run multiple operating systems simultaneously on a single physical machine by creating and managing virtual machines.
This can be useful for testing, development, and running applications that require different environments.

* The Project
We need to setup a server.
** LVM
- 2 encrypted partitions using *LVM* (Logical Volume Manager)

** What to turn in?
Only need to turn in a =signature.txt= file at the root of the repository.

Will contain the signature of the machine's virtual disk, e.g.: =sha256sum yourdisk.vdi=

The VM's signature may be altered after first evluation, need to virtual machin or use save state.

During Evaluation, signature will be compared to the one of the virtual machine.

* Disk image file
contains metadata about the virtual disk
- Disk geometry
- Information about the virtual disk's size and type (dynamic or fixed)
- Checksums and identifiers for data integrity and uniqueness
** formats
- =.vdi= VDI (Virtual Disk Image)
- VHD (Virtual Hard Disk)
- VMDK (Virtual Machin Disk)
