* What is virutal Box
VirtualBox is an open-source virtualization software developed by Oracle.
It allows users to run multiple operating systems simultaneously on a single physical machine by creating and managing virtual machines.
This can be useful for testing, development, and running applications that require different environments.

* The Project
We need to setup a server.
** LVM
- 2 encrypted partitions using *LVM* (Logical Volume Manager)
[[file:imgs/partition_scheme.png]]
** What to turn in?
Only need to turn in a =signature.txt= file at the root of the repository.

Will contain the signature of the machine's virtual disk, e.g.: =sha256sum yourdisk.vdi=

The VM's signature may be altered after first evluation, need to virtual machin or use save state.

During Evaluation, signature will be compared to the one of the virtual machine.
** Questions
*** theoretical
- [X] How does a virtual machine work ? And what its purpose ?
- [X] Why did you choose Debian or CentOS ?
- [X] What's the difference between Debian and CentOS ?
  - [X] If you chose Debian: what's the difference between aptitude, apt and what's APPArmor ?
  - [X] If you chose CentOS: what's SELinux and DNF ?
- [X] What's a partition ? And more generally how does LVM (Logical Volume Management) work ?
- [ ] What's sudo ?
- [ ] What are the advantages/disadvantages of a strong password policy ? What can you say about its implementation ?
- [ ] What's SSH (Secure Shell) and what's the value of using it ?
- [ ] What's an UFW and what's the value of using it ?
- [ ] What is cron ?
*** practical
**** DONE sudo
- [X] configure \sudo following strict rules
  - [X] Authentication using \sudo has to be limited to 3 attempts (incorrect password)
  - [X] *custom msg* of your choice if an error due to a wrong pw occurs
  - [X] each action using \sudo has to be archived, both inputs and outputs
    - [X] log file saved in =/var/log/sudo/= folder
  - [X] =TTY mode= has to be enabled for security reasons
  - [X] Paths that can be used by \sudo must be restricted e.g. =/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/snap/bin=
**** DONE password policy
- [X] implement a strong password policy
  - [X] expiration every 30 days
  - [X] minimum nbr of days allowed before modification = 2
  - [X] user receives a warning message 7 days before their password expires
  - [X] min 10 chars long
  - [X] must contain uppercase letter and a number
  - [X] must not contain more than 3 consecutive identical chars
  - [X] must not include the name of the user (gecos check)
  - [X] must have at least 7 chars that are not part of the former password
  - [X] root password has to comply with this policy
- [X] After setting up your configuration files, you will have to change all the passwords of the accounts present on the virtual machine, including the root account.
***** DONE Test
- [X] implement a strong password policy
  - [X] expiration every 30 days
  - [X] minimum nbr of days allowed before modification = 2
  - [X] user receives a warning message 7 days before their password expires
  - [X] min 10 chars long
  - [X] must contain uppercase letter and a number
    - [X] number
    - [X] uppercase
  - [X] must not contain more than 3 consecutive identical chars
  - [X] must not include the name of the user (gecos check)
  - [X] must have at least 7 chars that are not part of the former password
  - [X] root password has to comply with this policy
**** DONE hostname and user
- [X] hostname = kfreyer42
- [X] in addition to root user, a user with your login as username has to be present
  - [X] user has to belong to the \user42 and \sudo groups
  - during defense, you will have to create a new user and assign it to a group
**** TODO ssh
- [X] \SSH service running on port 4242
  - [X] shall not be possible to connect using \SSH as root
- use of \SSH will be tested during the defense by setting up a new account
***** how to
1. install openssh-server
2.
***** Test
- [ ] \SSH service running on port 4242
  - [ ] shall not be possible to connect using \SSH as root
**** TODO firewall
- [X] configure \UFW
  - [X] only leave 4242 open
  - [X] must be active when you launch your virtual machine
**** TODO script - monitoring.sh
- in bash
- [ ] display information at server startup on all terminals every 10 minutes (*wall (1)*)
- information
  - [ ] architecture of OS and kernel version
  - [ ] number of physical processors
  - [ ] number of virtual processors
  - [ ] The available RAM on your server and its utilization rate as a percentage.
  - [ ] The available memory on your server and its utilization rate as a percentage.
  - [ ] The utilization rate of your processors as a percentage.
  - [ ] The date and time of the last reboot.
  - [ ] Whether LVM is active or not.
  - [ ] The number of active connections.
  - [ ] The number of users using the server.
  - [ ] The IPv4 address of your server and its MAC (Media Access Control) address.
  - [ ] The number of commands executed with the sudo program.
- [ ] will need to interrupt the script without modifying it
  - take a look at *cron*
[[file:imgs/script_output.png]]
- =head -n 2 /etc/os-release=
- =ss -tunlp=
-
**** TODO Signature checking
- [ ] Check that the signature contained is identical to that of the ".vdi" file of the virtual machine to be evaluated.
** Bonus
- Set up a functional WordPress website with the following services:
  - lighttpd, MariaDB, and PHP.
- Set up a service of your choice that you think is useful (NGINX / Apache2 excluded!)
- During the defense, you will have to justify your choice.
- may open more ports to suit your needs
  - adapt UFW accordingly

* Disk image file
contains metadata about the virtual disk
- Disk geometry
- Information about the virtual disk's size and type (dynamic or fixed)
- Checksums and identifiers for data integrity and uniqueness
** formats
- =.vdi= VDI (Virtual Disk Image)
- VHD (Virtual Hard Disk)
- VMDK (Virtual Machin Disk)
