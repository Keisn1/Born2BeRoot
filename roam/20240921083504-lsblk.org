** what are major and minor device numbers?

Major and minor device numbers are identifiers used by the Linux kernel to access devices.

- *Major number*: This indicates the driver associated with the device. Each type of device (like hard drives or USB drives) has a unique major number that tells the kernel which driver to use.

- *Minor number*: This identifies a specific device or a partition handled by the driver. For example, two partitions on the same hard drive would have the same major number (because they use the same driver) but different minor numbers.

Together, these numbers uniquely identify a device in the system.
