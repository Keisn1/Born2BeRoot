udp - User Datagram Protocol for IPv4

UDP, or User Datagram Protocol, is another core protocol of the Internet Protocol Suite.

Unlike TCP, UDP is connectionless and focuses on providing low-latency communication.

Here are some key features of UDP:

1. *Connectionless*: Does not establish a connection before sending data.
2. *Unreliable*: Does not guarantee delivery, order, or error-checking of data packets.
3. *Low overhead*: Lacks the extensive control mechanisms of TCP, making it faster for use cases where speed is more critical than reliability.
4. *No flow or congestion control*: It does not manage the rate of data transmission, which can lead to potential data loss in congested networks.

UDP is commonly used in applications where speed is essential, and occasional data loss is acceptable, such as:

- Streaming media (audio/video)
- Online gaming
- Voice over IP (VoIP)
- DNS queries

Its simplicity makes it ideal for scenarios requiring fast, efficient data transmission without the overhead of TCP's reliability features.
