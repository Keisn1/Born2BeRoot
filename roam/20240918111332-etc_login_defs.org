login.defs - shadow password suite configuration

=login.defs= is a configuration file in Unix-based systems that defines default settings for user authentication and login behavior.

It contains parameters such as password expiration policy, password complexity requirements, and login session settings.

Modifying this file allows system administrators to customize how user logins are managed on the system.
