The key difference between Mandatory Access Control (MAC) and Discretionary Access Control (DAC) lies in how access permissions are managed and enforced:

1. *Discretionary Access Control (DAC):*
   - *User Control:* In DAC, the owner of a resource, such as a file or directory, has the discretion to set access permissions for other users. This means the resource owner can determine who has read, write, or execute permissions.
   - *Flexibility vs. Security:* While DAC is flexible and user-friendly, it relies on each user to set appropriate permissions, which can lead to security vulnerabilities if users do not configure settings carefully.
   - *Common in Many Systems:* DAC is the default access control model in many operating systems, including standard UNIX and Linux file systems.

2. *Mandatory Access Control (MAC):*
   - *System Control:* In MAC, access policies are centrally defined by a system administrator or security policy, with strict enforcement by the system itself. Users cannot change permissions on their own.
   - *Enhanced Security:* Since access controls are not left to the discretion of individual users, MAC provides a higher level of security, enforcing consistent policies across all users and applications.
   - *Used in High-Security Environments:* MAC is often used in environments where security is crucial, such as military or government systems. Systems like SELinux and AppArmor are examples of MAC implementations in Linux.

In summary, while DAC allows users significant control over their resources, MAC centralizes control under a security policy to ensure consistent and stringent access control.
