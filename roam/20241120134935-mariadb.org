* what is MariaDB?

MariaDB is an open-source relational database management system (RDBMS) that is a fork of MySQL.

It was created by the original developers of MySQL after MySQL was acquired by Oracle Corporation.

MariaDB aims to maintain high compatibility with MySQL, ensuring that all MySQL features and commands are supported. It is known for:

- /Improved Performance/: Offers optimizations and performance improvements over MySQL.
- /Enhanced Features/: Includes additional storage engines, better replication, and new features like dynamic columns and support for JSON functions.
- /Open Development/: Emphasizes transparency, with its codebase being open-source and freely available for community contributions.
- /Enterprise-Level Capabilities/: Provides features suitable for larger, enterprise environments such as advanced clustering and high availability.

MariaDB is widely used as a drop-in replacement for MySQL in many applications.
