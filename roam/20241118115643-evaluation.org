* General
- [ ] check that signature.txt file is present
- [ ] check that the signature equals matches signature of .vdi that is being evaluated
  - get the signature in sha1sum format ([[id:08fa09d2-0013-47d1-8ff6-092fb08941df][Verifying authenticity]])
    #+begin_src shell
sha1sum vm.vdi
    #+end_src
  - maybe compare directly (adding vm.vdi) after the hash
    #+begin_src shell
sha1sum -c signature.txt
    #+end_src
- may duplicate virtual machine to keep a copy
* Mandatory
** Project overview
- [ ] basic functioning of the [[id:3215f99f-5524-4986-9fc7-58eb820d946c][virtual machine]]
  - [ ] what is a [[id:3215f99f-5524-4986-9fc7-58eb820d946c][virtual machine]]
    - [ ] What are the [[id:b9fe227c-3dfa-4397-a06a-1bc6f141d1b7][benefits of virtual machines]]
  - [ ] What is a [[id:7b33a4a9-c577-4885-ab9c-3710818f8e0e][VirtualBox]]?
  - [ ] Why did you choose Debian/Rocky ([[id:2cc4639c-594b-43ea-bdb8-b00fb07643c3][Differences between Centos and Debian and Rocky]])
    - [ ] Rocky
      - [ ] explain SELinux and DNF
    - [ ] Debian
      - [ ] difference between [[id:b52d3445-d59d-4d43-bc92-3e9a70e5afe3][apt]] and [[id:b52d3445-d59d-4d43-bc92-3e9a70e5afe3][aptitude]]
      - [ ] what is [[id:ae006e35-647d-4e8d-9b71-85ff017c2cec][AppArmor]]
** Simple configuration
- [ ] verify that there is no graphical environment at startup
- [ ] password is requested before any connection attempt to the machine
- [ ] login with a non-root user
- [ ] verify that the password respects the rules imposed by the subject
- [ ] with help of evaluator verify that
  - [ ] make sure that OS is indeed Debian or Rocky
  - [ ] ufw is launched correctly
  - [ ] ssh service is launched properly
