Bogomips (short for "bogus millions of instructions per second") are a measurement of CPU speed used by the Linux kernel to calibrate internal timing loops.

It's calculated during system boot and primarily used for the kernel's internal timing purposes, not for performance benchmarking.

Essentially, it represents the number of million times per second a processor can do nothing.
