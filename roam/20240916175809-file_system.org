- crucial component of the operating system that manages how [[id:ac795948-2113-4a15-83ab-a2762dbfc2b6][files]] are stored, organized, and accessed
- without a filesystem, one wouldn't know how to access the files
  - incompatibility
  - data corruption
  - data loss
  - resource contention
- *local* - a capability of the OS
- *distributed* - file access between networked computers
* What it does
1. *Storage and Organization*:
   - keeps track of where each file is stored on your storage devices (like your hard drive or SSD)
   - organizes them into a structure, typically with directories and subdirectories
2. *Access and Management*: I
   - handles how you open, save, move, and delete files
   - making sure you can quickly find and work with your stuff without getting lost in a sea of data.
* Differences in file systems
1. *Performance*:
   - optimized for different types of hardware and use cases
     - optimized for speeding up access times on SSDs
     - optimized for handling large volumes of data on traditional hard drives

2. *Compatibility*:
   - Different operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux, etc.) may use different file systems for better integration and compatibility.
     - Windows ... NTFS
     - macOS ... APFS.
     - linux ... EXT4

3. *Features*:
   - advanced features like encryption, compression, journaling (which helps recover from crashes), and snapshots (saving the state of the system at a given point in time)

4. *Scalability*:
   - Certain file systems are better suited for small devices like USB drives (FAT32)
   - massive data centers and servers (ZFS, Btrfs).

5. *Reliability*:
   - fault-tolerance
   - handling data corruption or loss

* Special file systems
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_system#Special_file_systems
- expose elements of the OS as files (can be acted on via the file system API)
- common in UNIX like systems
