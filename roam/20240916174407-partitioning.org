- A partition is a dedicated area on the hard disk
- A hard disk needs to have a partition table
  - stores informations about the partitions' locations and sizes
- Seperates the memory region from the other space of the hard disk
- managed seperately
- allows use of different [[id:e7b6e1e8-e8b5-470a-9994-ebe4cab5a631][filesystems]] to be installed for different kinds of files
- happens before any file system is created
- A partition has its own filesystem
- A partition can be mounted

* primary / extended / logical partitions
** primary partitions
- basic partitions that can contain an operating system and are limited to four per disk
  - the partition is formatted with a file system and holds the necessary files and data required to [[id:e9d57b8a-ac31-490a-9e31-2cbfa65ac836][boot]] and run an operating system
** extended partition
- can be divided into logical partitions
- no need to assign a drive letter and install a file system
- may be used when limit of 4 drives per physical disk is reached
** logical partitions
- Logical partitions are created within an extended partition, which is a special type of primary partition that can hold multiple logical partitions.
- allow for more than four partitions on a disk and are commonly used for data storage rather than booting an operating system
* [[id:e9d57b8a-ac31-490a-9e31-2cbfa65ac836][boot]] partition
- necessary files for booting an operating system are typically stored in the boot partition
  - which is a specific partition that holds the bootloader and other essential system files required for the system to start up
- boot partition is usually separate from the partition that contains the core system files and user data
- some operating systems may use a single partition for both boot files and system files
