* what is php-fpm?

PHP-FPM (PHP FastCGI Process Manager) is an alternative PHP implementation designed to handle web requests more efficiently in a fast and scalable way. It significantly improves the performance of PHP applications by managing pools of worker processes that can handle multiple requests simultaneously. Key features of PHP-FPM include:

- *Advanced Process Management*: It allows for adaptive spawning, which helps in controlling the number of worker processes based on load.
- *Error Handling*: Isolates requests to prevent a single request failure from affecting others.
- *Smooth Reloads*: Supports zero-downtime restarts, allowing configuration changes to be applied without interrupting service.
- *Improved Logging*: Offers more robust logging for PHP errors and activity.

PHP-FPM is commonly used with web servers like Nginx and Apache to serve PHP applications efficiently.
