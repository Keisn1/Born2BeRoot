* what is meant by isolating applications in user-space?

- what is user-space?
  - space in memory that is seperated from kernel-space
- applications have their own seperate execution environment
  - by using containers like in [[id:d5801ab6-8b2a-493b-9c84-c4c31db77359][docker]]
  - without direct acess to kernel or hardware
  - each application has its own filesystem, libraries, configuration and network interfaces

This isolation in user-space means:
1. *Resource Management*: Each application can be limited to specific CPU, memory, and disk resources.
2. *Security*: Each container is typically sandboxed, reducing the risk that a vulnerability in one application will affect others or the host system.
3. *Independence*: Applications can run with different configurations, dependencies, or versions without conflicting with each other.
4. *Consistency*: Containers can be moved and run consistently across different environments, as they encapsulate everything needed for the application to run.

This approach contrasts with virtual machines, where each VM includes its own full operating system, running both user-space and kernel-space components.
