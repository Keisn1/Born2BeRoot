* What is LVM?
[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_volume_management][LVM wikipedia]]
- founded on [[id:fd984049-c9b8-4680-be50-87c67e849d87][Device mapper]]
- more flexible way of doing [[id:95012461-8e52-4e4f-8129-d9afa2f293b0][Partitioning]]
- concatenate, [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_striping][stripe]], combine partitions into larger virtual partitions
- administrators can re-size or move them, potenttially without interrupting system use
- part of the *device driver stack*  inside an OS
* LVM Design
** PV - physical volumes
- hard disks, hard disk partitions, Logical Unit Numbers
- VolManagement treats each *PV* as a sequence of chunks called *physical extents* (=PEs=)
- PE's map one-to-one to *logical extents* =LEs=
** volume groups
- LEs are pooled into a /volume group/ (combining extents)
- pooled LEs can be concatenated into virtual disk partitions (*logical volumes*)
