/proc/cpuinfo - CPU and system architecture information

This  is  a  collection  of CPU and system architecture dependent items, for each supported architecture  a  different  list.

Two common entries are processor which gives CPU number and [[id:a9a910b4-4ce0-418f-b8dd-caca1489ae06][bogomips]]; a  system  constant  that is calculated during kernel initialization.

SMP machines have information for each CPU.  The  lscpu(1) command gathers its information from this file.
