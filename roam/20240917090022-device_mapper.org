#+startup: overview

- framework that maps physical *[[id:2290051d-1a9c-41c8-9df0-5bce56561de3][block devices]]* onto higher-level /virtual block devices/
- foundation for *[[id:54ac0f8b-f519-4eee-b3f6-8706f7d23145][LVM]]*, *RAID*, *dm-crypt*
- offers features such as *file system snapshots*
- passing data from a /virtual block device/ (provided by the device mapper itself) to another block device
- during transition, data can also be modified (e.g. encryption)

* Usage
- Apps talk to device mapper (via =libdevmapper.so= shared library)
  - e.g. creation of new mapped devicesj
- device mapper issues =ioctls= to =/dev/mapper/control/= [[*Special files][device node]]
- configuration of device mapper via [[https://man.cx/?page=dmsetup(8)][dmsetup]]
