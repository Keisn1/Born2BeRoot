#+startup: overview

* General
- [ ] check that signature.txt file is present
- [ ] check that the signature equals matches signature of .vdi that is being evaluated
  - get the signature in sha1sum format ([[id:08fa09d2-0013-47d1-8ff6-092fb08941df][Verifying authenticity]])
    #+begin_src shell
sha1sum vm.vdi
    #+end_src
  - maybe compare directly (adding vm.vdi) after the hash
    #+begin_src shell
sha1sum -c signature.txt
    #+end_src
- may duplicate virtual machine to keep a copy
* Mandatory

  - [ ] What is a [[id:7b33a4a9-c577-4885-ab9c-3710818f8e0e][VirtualBox]]?
  - [ ] Why did you choose Debian/Rocky ([[id:2cc4639c-594b-43ea-bdb8-b00fb07643c3][Differences between Centos and Debian and Rocky]])
    - [ ] Rocky
      - [ ] explain SELinux and DNF
    - [ ] Debian
      - [ ] difference between [[id:b52d3445-d59d-4d43-bc92-3e9a70e5afe3][apt]] and [[id:b52d3445-d59d-4d43-bc92-3e9a70e5afe3][aptitude]]
      - [ ] what is [[id:ae006e35-647d-4e8d-9b71-85ff017c2cec][AppArmor]]
** Simple configuration

- [ ] password is requested before any connection attempt to the machine
- [ ] login with a non-root user
- [ ] verify that the password respects the rules imposed by the subject
- [ ] with help of evaluator verify that
  - [ ] make sure that OS is indeed Debian or Rocky
  - [ ] ufw is launched correctly
  - [ ] ssh service is launched properly
** User
- [ ] a user with the login name of the evaluated person be present on the virtual machine
- [ ] verify that the user belongs to the user42 and sudo groups
  - [ ] [[id:2a8f7b06-1518-43a5-a072-63403a5d4f14][add a new group]]
  - [ ] [[id:5b69c790-b6b5-44e8-b639-116852023e08][usermod]] , [[id:f83d268e-9fc8-42ee-a1c7-5cca096d0b7d][add user to group]]
  - [ ] [[id:69d45f6f-6430-4e3f-81db-33747ec8875b][add user to sudo group]]
  - [ ] verify (=groups <username>=)
- [ ] Ensure the rules imposed in the subject concerning the password policy have been implemented by following the steps below.
  - [ ] create a new user [[id:fb8cc514-3231-44bb-b75f-e68f34ed3c77][useradd]] and check that [[id:efa45dd1-828a-4fe4-a671-d4821eda00d9][password policy]] has been implemented
  - [ ] let the student explain how they implemented the rule
  - [ ] ask the evaluated person to create a group named "evaluating" in front of you and assign it to this user
  - [ ] Finally, check that this user indeed belongs to the "evaluating" group. ([[id:2a8f7b06-1518-43a5-a072-63403a5d4f14][add a new group]])
  - [ ] To finish, ask the evaluated person to explain the purpose of this password policy, as well as the advantages and disadvantages of its implementation. ([[id:83c2bee7-c27e-4685-b323-f16ab7200da5][why do we choose to implement a strong password policy?]])
** [[id:c7a2fa4c-cb32-4af3-bbe4-faa3ed30543f][hostname]] and partitions
- [ ] Verify that the hostname of the machine is formatted as follows: login42 (login of the evaluated person).
- [ ] Change this hostname by replacing the login with yours, then restart the machine. If upon restarting, the hostname has not been updated, the evaluation stops here.
- [ ] You can now restore the original hostname of the machine.
- [ ] Ask the evaluated person how to display the partitions of their virtual machine.
- [ ] Compare the output with the example given in the subject. Note: if the evaluated person has done the bonuses, you should refer to the example from the bonus part.
- [ ] This part is an opportunity to discuss partitions!
  - [ ] The evaluated person must give you a brief explanation of how LVM works and why it's beneficial.
*** implementation
- [[id:77dc2229-daa6-4d46-8f26-898967385f5e][change hostname permanently]]
** sudo
- [ ] Verify that the "sudo" program is indeed installed on the virtual machine.
- [ ] The evaluated person must now show how to assign your new user to the "sudo" group.
- [ ] The subject imposes strict rules for sudo.
  - [ ] explain the purpose and operation of [[id:4fe552a3-a369-4dd1-a292-a3a897e0fe2f][sudo]] with examples of your choice.

    - [ ] Authentication using \sudo has to be limited to 3 attempts (incorrect password)
    - [ ] *custom msg* of your choice if an error due to a wrong pw occurs
    - [ ] each action using \sudo has to be archived, both inputs and outputs
      - [ ] log file saved in =/var/log/sudo/= folder
    - [ ] =TTY mode= has to be enabled for security reasons
    - [ ] Paths that can be used by \sudo must be restricted e.g. =/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/snap/bin=
- [ ] Verify that the "/var/log/sudo/" directory exists and contains at least one file.
- [ ] Check the contents of the files in this directory; you should see a history of commands used with sudo
- [ ] Finally, attempt to run a command via sudo.
  - [ ] Check if the file(s) in the "/var/log/sudo/" directory have been updated.
** password policy

*** how can I check in a simple way that requiretty for sudo is enforced in my virtualmachine. (But not by looking at /etc/sudoers)

You can test if =requiretty= is enforced by attempting to run a command with =sudo= in a non-interactive shell. Hereâ€™s a simple approach:

1. Use =ssh= to run a command on your local machine as your user (replace =localhost= with your machine's actual hostname if necessary).

   #+begin_src bash
   ssh localhost 'sudo echo This works'
   #+end_src

2. If =requiretty= is enforced, you will get an error message like:

   #+begin_src
   sudo: sorry, you must have a tty to run sudo
   #+end_src

If it executes without an error, then =requiretty= is not enforced for your user. Make sure that =ssh= is configured to allow local connections without passwords, or this check might not work as expected.

** ssh
- [ ] Verify that the SSH service is indeed installed on the virtual machine.
- [ ] Verify that it is functioning correctly.
  - [ ] must be active when you launch your virtual machine
  - [ ] shall not be possible to connect using \SSH as root
  - [ ] Verify that the SSH service uses only port 4242
    - =sudo ss -tlnp | grep sshd=
- [ ] The evaluated person must give you a basic explanation of what SSH is and why it's important to use it.
- [ ] use SSH to connect with the new user

** script - [[id:b35074bc-77bd-4e23-9f0a-83e706499a6b][monitoring sh]]
[[file:~/workspace/Born2BeRoot/imgs/script_output.png]]

- [ ] explain operations of their script (must display their code)
- [ ] explain what =cron= is
- [ ]  How they have set up their script to execute every 10 minutes from server launch.
  - [ ] the evaluated person must make sure that this script executes every minute.
  - [ ] You can launch whatever you wish to ensure that the script runs correctly with dynamic values.
  - [ ] Finally, the evaluated person must ensure that the script no longer runs at server launch, without modifying the script itself.
    - [ ] To verify this point, the server will need to be restarted one last time.
    - [ ] At startup, it must be verified that the script still exists in the same place, that its permissions have remained unchanged, and that it has not been modified.
