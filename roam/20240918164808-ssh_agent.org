=ssh-agent= is a program that acts as a key manager for SSH (Secure Shell).

It holds private keys used for public key authentication (key-based authentication) in memory, effectively managing your SSH keys and passphrases so you don't have to repeatedly enter your passphrase for each SSH connection.

Hereâ€™s how it typically works:
1. You start =ssh-agent=, which runs in the background.
2. You add your private key to =ssh-agent= using the =ssh-add= command.
3. =ssh-agent= caches the key in memory for the duration of your session.
4. When you attempt to SSH into another machine, =ssh-agent= provides the necessary authentication without requiring you to re-enter your key's passphrase each time.

Common commands associated with =ssh-agent= include:
- Starting =ssh-agent=:
  #+begin_example sh
  eval $(ssh-agent)
  #+end_example

- Adding an SSH key to the agent:
  #+begin_example sh
  ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
  #+end_example

- Listing currently loaded keys in =ssh-agent=:
  #+begin_example sh
  ssh-add -l
  #+end_example

- Removing a key from the agent:
  #+begin_example sh
  ssh-add -d ~/.ssh/id_rsa
  #+end_example

- Stopping =ssh-agent=:
  #+begin_example sh
  eval $(ssh-agent -k)
  #+end_example

Using =ssh-agent= enhances convenience and security by reducing the need to repeatedly enter passphrases while maintaining the security benefits of SSH key-based authentication.
