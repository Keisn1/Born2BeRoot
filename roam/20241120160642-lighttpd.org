Lighttpd is an open-source web server that is designed to be fast, secure, and consume minimal system resources.

It is particularly well-suited for high-performance server environments and supports features such as FastCGI, SCGI, URL rewriting, and HTTP/2.

Lighttpd is often used in situations where efficiency and speed are critical, such as when serving static content or in embedded systems.

Its lightweight design makes it a popular choice for environments with limited resources.
