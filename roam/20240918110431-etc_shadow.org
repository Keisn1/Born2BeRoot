#+startup: overview

The =/etc/shadow= file is a critical system file in Unix-like operating systems that contains encrypted password information and related aging data for user accounts.
Each line in the file corresponds to a user account and includes fields such as:

- Username
- Encrypted password (or placeholder if using another authentication method)
- Date of the last password change
- Minimum and maximum password age
- Password expiration warning period
- Inactivity period before the account is locked
- Account expiration date

The =/etc/shadow= file is readable only by the root user to enhance security, as it contains sensitive authentication data.
