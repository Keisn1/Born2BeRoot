[[id:d5801ab6-8b2a-493b-9c84-c4c31db77359][Docker]] and [[id:7b33a4a9-c577-4885-ab9c-3710818f8e0e][VirtualBox]] both enable running applications in isolated environments, but they do so in different ways:

|                  | Docker                                     | VirtualBox                                 |
|------------------+--------------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------|
| Isolation Method | Containerization                           | emulates entire hardware and runs full OS  |
|                  | sharing hosts system kernel                |                                            |
|                  | while [[id:9d247105-0272-499a-a700-519761282898][isolating applications in user space]] |                                            |
|                  |                                            |                                            |
| Performance      | lower overhead                             | higher overhead                            |
|                  |                                            | consumes more CPU, memory and disk space   |
|                  |                                            |                                            |
| Use cases        | deploying and scaling applications quickly | dev envs where different OSes are required |
|                  | CI/CD workflows                            | developement across various OSes           |
|                  | microservices                              |                                            |
|                  |                                            |                                            |
| Portability      | highly portable                            | portable but require more effort due to    |
|                  | run consistently across different envs     | large size                                 |
|                  | (maintained by docker itself)              | dependency on Virtualization software      |
