tcp - TCP protocol

TCP, or Transmission Control Protocol, is one of the core protocols of the Internet Protocol Suite.
It provides reliable, ordered, and error-checked delivery of data between applications running on hosts in an IP network.

Here are some key features of TCP:

1. *Connection-oriented*: Establishes a connection before data can be sent.
2. *Reliable*: Ensures data is delivered accurately and in the same order it was sent.
3. *Error-checking*: Uses checksums to detect errors in data.
4. *Flow control*: Manages the rate of data transmission between source and destination.
5. *Congestion control*: Prevents network congestion by adjusting the rate of data transmission based on network conditions.

TCP is used by many important internet applications, including web browsers (HTTP/HTTPS), email (SMTP/IMAP/POP), and file transfers (FTP).
