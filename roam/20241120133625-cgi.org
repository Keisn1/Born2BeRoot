CGI, or Common Gateway Interface, is a *standard protocol* used to enable web servers to execute external programs, usually scripts, and generate dynamic web content.

When a web server receives a request for a *CGI script*, it executes the script as a separate process and sends the script's output back to the client as part of the HTTP response. Key aspects of CGI include:

- *Interactivity*: Allows web pages to interact with server-side scripts, generating dynamic content based on user input.
- *Language Agnostic*: CGI scripts can be written in various programming languages, such as Perl, Python, or C/C++.
- *Simple Operation*: Follows a straightforward protocol where the web server and scripts communicate using standard input (stdin) and output (stdout).

While CGI laid the groundwork for dynamic web applications, it's generally less efficient than newer technologies like FastCGI and application servers, mainly because it creates a new process for every request.
