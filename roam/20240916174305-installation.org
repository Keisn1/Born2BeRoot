#+title: Installation Debian
#+date: [2024-09-16 Mon 17:43]
#+startup: overview

- in VMBox, do it with graphic install, otherwise problems with selecting checkboxes
* Downloading Debian
[[https://www.debian.org/download]]
* Check checksum and signature
** why?
1. used to check that the images have not been corrupted during download
2. signatures allow to confirm that the images are the ones created and releaded by Debian
** How to
([[https://www.debian.org/CD/verify][Verifying authenticity of Debian images]])

1. verify that checksums files themselves are correct
   1. Accessing [[https://keyring.debian.org/][Debine Public Key Server]]
      - provide HKP (HTTP Keyserver Protocol) /lookup/ and /add/ requests for Debian developer and maintainer *public keys*
      - via pgp implementation (e.g. =gpg=)
        =gpg --keyserver keyring.debian.org --recv-keys <key_id>=
      - example key_ids on https://www.debian.org/CD/verify
   2. Checksum verification
      #+begin_src shell
sha512sum -c <checksum_file>.sha512
      #+end_src
      - -c ... --check  ... read checksums from the files and check them
* [[id:95012461-8e52-4e4f-8129-d9afa2f293b0][Partitioning]]
1. manual
2. Create new partition table on the hard disk
3. Create new primary partition on the hard disk - boot partition (Mount Point =/boot=)
4. Create encrypted partition (on the rest of the hard disk) (creates a logical )
5. Configure [[id:54ac0f8b-f519-4eee-b3f6-8706f7d23145][LVM]]
   - in names of the volumegroup and the volumes itself, a dash becomes a double-dash
   - var-log is a sub-volume of var, I think it needs to have less space than var (otherwise I got an error)
