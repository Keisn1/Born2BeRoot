* what is php-cgi?

=php-cgi= is the [[id:7acf0303-7eda-40ec-9f86-681f19dff55d][CGI]] (Common Gateway Interface) version of PHP.

It allows PHP scripts to be executed by a web server using the CGI protocol.

In this setup, the web server launches a PHP process for each request, which can be less efficient than using [[id:f08f9d57-186a-4c65-8209-d40a1bfacae9][PHP-FPM]] or a module like mod_php with Apache. However, =php-cgi= can be useful in certain environments, such as when:

- A web server supports PHP only via the CGI protocol and you're unable to use more integrated methods like PHP-FPM.
- Isolation between requests is necessary because each request runs in its own process.
- Itâ€™s needed to test or simulate a CGI-based setup.

While =php-cgi= provides basic functionality for executing PHP scripts, it generally lacks the performance optimizations and advanced features found in PHP-FPM.
