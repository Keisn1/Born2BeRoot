A networking mode in virtualization software defines how a virtual machine communicates with the physical network and other devices.
It determines how network traffic is managed between the virtual machine and the host system or external networks.

* NAT
** what is "NAT"?

NAT stands for Network Address Translation. It is a technology used in computer networking to allow multiple devices on a local network to share a single public IP address for accessing the internet.

** When in VirtualBox the enable network adapter is enabled and attached to NAT, what does it mean?

When a network adapter in VirtualBox is enabled and attached to NAT, it means that the virtual machine can access the internet through the host computer's network connection. The host computer acts as a gateway, handling the translation of network addresses for the virtual machine.

** How to connect via NAT
- one needs to configure the ports

** port forwarding

Means, that whatever traffic goes on 4242 port on host machine, is redirected to 4242 on guest machine

Port forwarding is a technique used to redirect network traffic from one network port on a network node to another port on a different node. It allows incoming connections to reach a specific service or application running on a different network device.

If you set up port forwarding in VirtualBox, incoming traffic on a specific port of the host machine will be redirected to a corresponding port on the guest virtual machine. This allows external systems to communicate with services running inside the virtual machine.

* Bridged Adapter

In VirtualBox, a Bridged Adapter allows the virtual machine to appear as a separate device on the physical network to which the host computer is connected. It gets its own IP address and can be accessed directly from other devices on the same network.
