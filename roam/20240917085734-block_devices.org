- provide
  - buffered access to hardware devices (in contrast to character devices)
  - some abstraction from their specifics
- allow to *read* or *write* a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_(data_storage)][block]] of any size and any alignment
  - in computing a block refers to a sequence of bytes (or bits)
  - a number of *physical records*
  - usually stored in a *data buffer*
  - reduces overhead, speeds up handling of *data stream*
  - alignment refers to the position wihtin the storage medium
- downside
  - possible data corruption while buffering
- *FreeBSD* - only character devices
- *Linux* - only block-devices
  - would need to open the device with =O_DIRECT=
- most file systems are based on block devices
