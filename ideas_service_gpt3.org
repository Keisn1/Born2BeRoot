*** i just configured a web server and now i'm searching for a useful service  (NGINX / Apache2 excluded) that i could set up

You could consider setting up a caching server like Varnish or a reverse proxy server like HAProxy. Both can improve the performance and reliability of your web server setup.

*** what is varnish?

Varnish is a popular caching server that sits in front of your web server and caches content to speed up page loading times, reduce server load, and improve scalability.

*** and what is HAProxy?

HAProxy is a versatile and reliable open-source TCP/HTTP load balancer and proxy server that can distribute incoming traffic to multiple backend servers, ensuring high availability and performance for your web applications.

*** could varnish be used in combination with wordpress?

Yes, Varnish can be used with WordPress to cache static content and reduce server load, improving the performance of your WordPress site.

*** what about caddy?

Caddy is a lightweight web server with automatic HTTPS capabilities. It can also be used as a reverse proxy, similar to NGINX or Apache, and can serve as a good alternative for serving websites and applications.

*** what are other caching server?

Other caching servers besides Varnish include Squid, Redis, Memcached, and LiteSpeed Cache. Each has its own strengths and use cases depending on your specific needs.

*** How do i set up wordpress on my server? With lighttpd, mariaDB and PHP?

You can set up WordPress with Lighttpd, MariaDB, and PHP by installing and configuring each component on your server. Make sure to set up PHP with FastCGI support in Lighttpd and create a database in MariaDB for WordPress to use.

*** what is (s)ftp software?

(S)FTP software refers to programs or applications that are used to transfer files securely over a network using either the FTP (File Transfer Protocol) or its secure version, SFTP (SSH File Transfer Protocol). Popular (S)FTP software includes FileZilla, WinSCP, and Cyberduck.

*** what is heroku?

Heroku is a cloud platform as a service (PaaS) that enables developers to build, deploy, and scale applications easily. It supports multiple programming languages and provides a managed environment for running web applications without worrying about infrastructure management.

*** they don't provide configurable servers, do they?

Heroku offers a managed platform where developers can deploy and scale applications without needing to manage servers directly. While developers can configure and scale their applications, they do not have direct access to or control over the underlying servers that Heroku manages.

*** i have a domain on godaddy. How do I connect it to my server?

To connect your domain on GoDaddy to your server, you will need to update the domain's DNS settings on GoDaddy to point to your server's IP address. This typically involves creating an "A" record or updating the nameservers to point to your server. The exact steps may vary depending on your server setup and hosting provider. You can usually find detailed instructions from your hosting provider or in the GoDaddy help documentation.

*** meine domain ist kaychen.org. Was wenn ich sowas haben will wie kaychen.wordpress.org?

Wenn du eine Subdomain wie kaychen.wordpress.org für deine Domain kaychen.org haben möchtest, müsstest du die DNS-Einstellungen deiner Domain entsprechend konfigurieren. Du könntest eine Subdomain wie z.B. wordpress.kaychen.org erstellen und auf deine WordPress-Installation verweisen. Die genauen Schritte hängen von deinem DNS-Anbieter ab und können in dessen Dokumentation nachgelesen werden.

*** wann sind subdomains zu empfehlen?

Subdomains sind zu empfehlen, wenn du verschiedene Abschnitte deiner Website oder separate Dienste klar voneinander trennen möchtest. Sie können auch für verschiedene Sprachversionen, spezifische Funktionen oder Unterprojekte verwendet werden. Subdomains helfen dabei, die Website-Struktur zu organisieren und verschiedene Bereiche sauber voneinander abzugrenzen.

*** may i use ssh to copy files from my local machine to a server?

Yes, you can use SSH (Secure Shell) to securely copy files from your local machine to a server using tools like SCP (Secure Copy) or SFTP (SSH File Transfer Protocol). These commands provide a secure way to transfer files between your local machine and a remote server over an encrypted connection.

*** how do you do it?

To copy files from your local machine to a server using SSH, you can use the =scp= command. For example, to copy a file named =example.txt= from your local machine to a remote server, you can use the following command:

#+begin_src
scp /path/to/local/file/example.txt username@server_ip:/path/to/remote/directory/
#+end_src

Replace =/path/to/local/file/example.txt= with the path to your local file, =username= with your username on the server, =server_ip= with the IP address of the server, and =/path/to/remote/directory/= with the path to the directory on the server where you want to copy the file.

Make sure you have SSH access to the server and the necessary permissions to write to the destination directory on the server.
